## Introduction

This assignment includes the following files:
<ol>
<li><b>plot1.R</b>: code that downloads the data, prepares it, produces the fixed data set, write it out to .csv and produces first plot as plot1.png  </li>
<li><b>plot1.png</b>: 1st plot as a png file of width 480pixels </li>
<li><b>plot2.R</b>: code to read the data prepared by plot1.R and produce 2nd plot and write out to plot2.png</li>
<li><b>plot2.png</b>: 2nd plot as a png file of width 480pixels </li>
<li><b>plot3.R</b>: code to read the data prepared by plot1.R and produce 3rd plot and write out to plot3.png</li>
<li><b>plot3.png</b>: 3rd plot as a png file of width 480pixels </li>
<li><b>plot4.R</b>: code to read the data prepared by plot1.R and produce 4th plot and write out to plot4.png</li>
<li><b>plot4.png</b>: 4th plot as a png file of width 480pixels </li>
</ol>

## Note:
In order to produce plots 2,3,4 you must first use plot1.R to produce the data set that is used by plot2/3/4.R
